Cosmic Particle Classification using KNN algorithm

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify gamma and hadron particles from the MAGIC Telescope dataset.
The data was normalized using StandardScaler and balanced using RandomOverSampler to handle class imbalance.
The trained KNN model predicts particle types with good accuracy, based on their feature similarity.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in this repository.
